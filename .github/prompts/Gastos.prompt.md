I'm working on a web application built with Blazor WebApp (.NET 9) and MudBlazor. The app allows users to import purchase receipts in PDF or image format, send them to an external API for OCR processing, and extract data such as store name, date, products, quantities, and amounts. The first time a store or product is detected, the user manually creates it; in subsequent readings, the app automatically associates the extracted data with the existing entities. The app includes full CRUD management for receipts, products, and stores, and allows users to visualize purchase data through date-range graphs.
